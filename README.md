# Molecule Generator
Deep learning seq2seq generator of molecular descriptors 
with given binding energy.
- Compounds are generated in SMILES format
- Neural network architecture is 
semi-supervised LSTM-autoencoder
- Additional neuron in latent space for binding free energy input

Was used to generate compounds 
that block the binding of the GP120 protein 
to the CD4 receptor and prevent
the penetration of HIV into the human body.
